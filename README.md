What is it?

RV Monitor is basically a Weather Station for a recreational vehicle.
Also integrates a few sensors to monitor air quality and dangerous levels of propane due to liquid gas leaks.
Project still under development. 

Components:
- Arduino UNO (probably will use ESP8266)
- DHT11 x 2
- Display LCD
